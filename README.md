Vehicle detection and tracking
# Goals of this project
Objective of this project is to create a Python script that can detect cars from the Video Image using a trained Classifier model by following:

Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
 Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
 Create a pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
 Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.
 Recreate the Video Stream with the output of pipeline
